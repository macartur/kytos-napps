Overview
========

The **of_topology** is a NApp responsible to update links between machines and
network devices (i.e. switches and routers) and then update the current state
of the network topology. This application depends of another application,
**of_lldp**, since it makes use of lldp packets to discover links between
network devices.

This application listens for two kinds of packet_in events. The first one is
lldp packets which carry information regarding the sender, such as port number,
mac address, switch id and interface. The other packet that this application
listens for is port status open flow messages. When a packet of this kind is
received, the application identifies which kind of change the packet is warning
about (i.e. created, deleted or modified). In both cases, the application
returns a Json file with all updated changes identified.
